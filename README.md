ixy.rs is a Rust rewrite of the [ixy](https://github.com/emmericp/ixy) userspace network driver.
It is designed to be readable, idiomatic Rust code.
It supports Intel 82599 10GbE NICs (`ixgbe` family).
Check out [our paper](https://www.net.in.tum.de/fileadmin/bibtex/publications/theses/2018-ixy-rust.pdf) to read about the details of our implementation.

## Features

* less than 2000 lines of Rust code for the driver and two sample applications
* simple API to use
* super fast, can forward > 26 million packets per second on a single 3.3 GHz CPU core
* documented code

## Build instructions

You will need Rust and its package manager `cargo`.
Install using:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

Ixy.rs uses hugepages. To enable them run:

```
cd ixy.rs
sudo ./setup-hugetlbfs.sh
```

To build the provided sample applications and execute them manually run:

```
cargo build --release --all-targets
```

The built binaries are located in `target/release/examples/`.

To build and execute the examples at once see **Usage**.

## Performance

Have a look at our [performance results](https://github.com/ixy-languages/ixy-languages#Performance) in the ixy-languages repository.

## Usage

There are two sample applications included in the ixy.rs crate.
You can run the packet generator with

```
sudo cargo run --release --example generator 0000:AA:BB.C 
```

and the forwarder with

```
sudo cargo run --release --example forwarder 0000:AA:BB.C 0000:AA:BB.D
```
